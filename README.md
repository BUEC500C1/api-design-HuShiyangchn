## Introduction
In this module, you can get the brief introduction about the airport and the current weather information about the airport which is based on Openweathermap API.
## Implementation
First I generated a file inlcuded all information about US airport based on airport-codes.csv which is produced by @svetozarstojkovic. More information about the file can be found in https://github.com/datasets/airport-codes. Then the program could provide short introduction about the airport and find the precise coordinates based on this file. Then the program can use the coordinates to call the API and get the precise weather information.
## Example
Run the program by type ```python3 weatherapi.py```
After running you should enter the name of the airport:
